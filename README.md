# Cat vs Dog Image Classifier

This project is a simple **Streamlit web app** that classifies uploaded images as either a **Cat** or a **Dog**, using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built in TensorFlow/Keras.

##  Demo
Upload a `.jpg` or `.png` image and the app predicts whether it shows a cat or a dog, along with the model's confidence score.

## Folder Structure

## Features
- Upload image from your computer
- View the image in the browser
- Get predicted label and confidence score
- Powered by TensorFlow and Streamlit

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cat-dog-streamlit.git
cd cat-dog-streamlit
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
